# Django Schedule Advisor Project
This class project was completed for CS 3240 Advanced Software Development at the University of Virginia. The program was developed to aid students in developing a class schedule by quering UVA's class API and storing it in a local database for faster access. The project was originally deployed on Heroku using a connection through GitHub Actions.
