# Django Schedule Advisor Project
This class project was completed for CS 3240 Advanced Software Development at the University of Virginia. The program was developed to aid students in developing a class schedule by quering UVA's class API and storing it in a local database for faster access. The project was originally deployed on Heroku using a connection through GitHub Actions. 

## Features:
- Two Account Types: Student and Advisor
- Error Messages and Input Validation
- Google Authentication through OAuth
- Dynamic updates to database based on user queries
- Session persistence through Django
- Creating schedules
- Adding/dropping classes from schedule (Student side)
- Approving/rejecting schedules (Advisor side)
